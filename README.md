# PittCompMethods
This is an assignment repository for Computational Methods at Pitt

## How diectories are structured

All files for assignments of ***Computational Methods*** are placed in the directory **Assignments**. The root directory for each assignment is "Assignments/Assignment_#". Each "Assignment_#" is a standalone directory for review, demostration and grading unless other instructions are provided in its own instruction file. Some instruction files have HTML version because Github Markdown doesn't support math expressions.

Files in "Exercises" are programs for exercises in Textbook not assigned by the professor.
