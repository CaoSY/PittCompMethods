# PittCompMethods
This is an assignment repository for Computational Methods at Pitt

## How diectories are structured

All files for assignments of ***Computational Methods*** are placed in the directory **Assignments**. The root directory for each assignment is "Assignments/Assignment_#". Each "Assignment_#" is a standalone directory for review, demostration and grading unless other instructions are provided in its own README file.

Files in "Exercises" serve as scratch papers for this course, which are irrelavent to assignments.
